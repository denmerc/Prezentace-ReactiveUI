            <summary>
            This binding type converter uses the built-in WPF component model 
            conversions to get a whole bunch of conversions for free. Unfortunately,
            these are pretty gutted on some other platforms like Silverlight.

            <summary>
            Because RxUI.dll is in a PLib, it doesn't have the SuperPowers it needs
            to be able to really detect whether it's in a unit test runner. This class
            is much better at it.

            <summary>
            Ignore me. This class is a secret handshake between RxUI and RxUI.Xaml
            in order to register certain classes on startup that would be difficult
            to register otherwise.
